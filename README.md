## About 
"[Murder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_mystery_game)" is short for "Interactive Murder Mystery Game" in French.

This project is an IMMG I created with for theme vampires. The game is not yet published but as for now, I use this repository to develop the python script used by the GM to manage players' stats and actions.
